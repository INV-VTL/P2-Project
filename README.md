# Analysis of House Sales through Regression Modeling

##### Author: Ryan S. Chung

## Overview

This project analyzes a data set containing information on house listings in order to create a statistical model which identifies features in the data set that would act as significant indicators towards predicting the selling price of a house's selling price.

## Business Problem

A real estate agency is looking to discover attributes of houses that act as significant indicators of their selling prices to take into consideration for their business plan when purchasing and selling residential property.  As they are looking to grow and maximize their overall profits and minimize  their expenses, the insights from this project will assist them in reaching their long term goals.

## Data

For this project the kc_house_data.csv was provided and used to create a multiple linear regression model.  The data set contained house listing information and various features for each listed property.  Some of the features include number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms and living space.

## Methods

This project uses descriptive analysis and statistical modeling in order to determine predictive features for housing selling prices.  In the case of this project, a multiple linear regression model was created with an iterative approach to its development and validation.

## Results

The multiple regression model created through an iterative approach indicated several housing features that were statistically relevant in predicting a house listings selling price.  These features include the overall footage of the lot, number of floors, whether the house has a waterfront view, whether its been viewed, the overall condition of the listing, the square footage of the basement, and the square footage of the land lots of the nearest 15 neighbors.

## Conclusions

In accordance with the results found in this project's multiple regression model, the real estate agency should take into consideration the indicated predictors of a houses selling price when purchasing and selling property.
